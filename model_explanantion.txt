###Logistic Regression Model Explanation

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for binary classification problems. In this project, it is used to predict customer churn by identifying whether a customer is likely to leave the service based on historical customer data. The model learns the relationship between input features and the target variable and estimates the probability of churn using a logistic (sigmoid) function. With appropriate preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling for numerical features and one-hot encoding for categorical features, Logistic Regression performs effectively on structured, tabular datasets.

Logistic Regression was selected as the final model for testing and deployment due to its stability, interpretability, and consistent performance. Compared to more complex models, it is less prone to overfitting, easier to deploy and maintain, and provides reliable predictions in production environments. Its simplicity also makes it well suited for real-time predictions through a REST API, which aligns well with the objectives of this project.
