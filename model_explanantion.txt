### Logistic Regression Model Explanation

Logistic Regression is a widely used supervised learning algorithm for binary
classification problems. In this project, it is used to predict whether a
customer is likely to churn (`Yes` or `No`) based on historical customer data.
The model estimates the probability of churn by learning the relationship
between input features and the target variable using a logistic (sigmoid)
function. It works efficiently with both numerical and categorical features
when combined with proper preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling
and one-hot encoding.

Logistic Regression was chosen as the final model for testing and deployment
because of its stability, interpretability, and consistent performance on
tabular datasets. Unlike more complex models, it is less prone to overfitting,
easier to debug during deployment, and provides reliable predictions in
production environments. Additionally, its simplicity makes it suitable for
real-time API-based predictions, which aligns well with the project
requirements.
